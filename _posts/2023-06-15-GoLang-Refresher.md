# Project Idea:

Getting a refresher on Go for my upcoming Tesla SRE interview. For this I want to incorporate a wide variety of applicable tasks that would be relevant in a SRE role and also hopefully learn something interesting along the way.

Here were some things that caught my eye.

# Problem Statement

DNA sequencing algorithm: Simulate the process of reading and assembling genetic sequences by aligning raw reads against reference genomes or de novo assembly.

I wanna do some de novo assembly of short sequences.

I can use the COVID 19 sequence as starter data rather than generating my own.
