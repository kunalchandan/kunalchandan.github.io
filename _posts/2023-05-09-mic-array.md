# Project idea
Microphone array that allows for beamforming.

## Requirements
- 4-6 microphones
- Analog filtering
- Analog to digital conversion for on-computer digital filtering

# Implementation

## Microphones

### Requirements
- Must meet $20Hz - 20kHz$ voice-band frequency range
- Must allow for analog sampling
- Preferably a MEMs microphone
  - Since it's cheaper
  - And usually smaller
- Must have datasheets and models because I don't hate myself

From the datasheet
![microphone array datasheet input requirements](/assets/img/mic_array/mic_powersupply_req.png)
we can see the microphone array datasheet input requirements.

Since we'll always want to operate in high performance mode, we can pick $3.3V$ for a power supply target voltage. This means that the power supply will need at a minimum to be able to support $0.2mA$ per microphone.

The datasheet also points to some relevant application notes.
