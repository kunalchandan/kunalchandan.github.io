# Project idea
Microphone array that allows for beamforming.

## Requirements
- 4-6 microphones
- Analog filtering
- Analog to digital conversion for on-computer digital filtering

# Part Selection

## Microphones

### Requirements
- Must meet $20Hz - 20kHz$ voice-band frequency range
- Must allow for analog sampling
- Preferably a MEMs microphone
  - Since it's cheaper
  - And usually smaller
- Must have datasheets and models because I don't hate myself

### Application notes

From the datasheet
![microphone array datasheet input requirements](/assets/img/mic_array/mic_powersupply_req.png)
we can see the microphone array datasheet input requirements.

Since we'll always want to operate in high performance mode, we can pick $3.3V$ for a power supply target voltage. This means that the power supply will need at a minimum to be able to support $0.2mA$ per microphone.

The datasheet also points to some relevant application notes.

[AN-1165 – Op Amps for MEMS Microphone Preamp Circuits](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Op-Amps-for-MEMS-Microphone-Preamp-Circuits.pdf)

The pre-amp circuit specified in the datasheet is

Datasheet suggests avoiding acoustic resonances from a Helmholtz resonator. However, we will just not bother with that and leave the microphones exposed for now. I really don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of mechanical design.

Now we can select an appropriate ADC since these microphones are essentially fine...

### Application Notes

From the [datasheet](https://d3uzseaevmutz1.cloudfront.net/pubs/proDatasheet/CS5366_F5.pdf) we see that the recommended input buffer looks like:


![recommended input buffer](/assets/img/mic_array/ideal_pre-amp-stage.png)


This pre-amp stage is used in the final design.


From the [datasheet](https://d3uzseaevmutz1.cloudfront.net/pubs/proDatasheet/CS5366_F5.pdf) we also see that the recommended typical connection diagram is the following:

![typical ADC](/assets/img/mic_array/typical-adc.png)

This means that we require a crystal oscillator that oscillates at a frequency between 1 and 6 $MHz$. I picked something out of the sky at $4MHz$.

![oscillator table](/assets/img/mic_array/oscillator_table.png)

After trying to read the datasheet for a few hours I have discovered I'd rather not use this one for arbitrary reasons and not just because I couldn't figure it out.


I am instead [going to use this one](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/analog-devices-inc/LTC1093CSW-PBF/962902). It's much simpler for simple people like me.

[This is the datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/1091fa.pdf)

We can see that the typical usage is very simple:

# Schematic

To do the schematic we first need to break out the microphones.

![microphones schematic](/assets/img/mic_array/mics-schematic.png)

We then need to pre-amp the microphones and use an instrumentation amplifier to retrieve the differential mode signal.

The instrumentation amplifier resistor was selected to provide a gain of $50x$

The [datasheet is here for the INA128](https://www.ti.com/product/INA128)


![amplifier schematic](/assets/img/mic_array/filters-and-buffers-schematic.png)

And now the ADC to raspberry breakout schematic looks as follows:

![top level schematic](/assets/img/mic_array/top-level-schematic.png)

# Layout

Since we want to be able to do beamforming, we can place them along some sort of array pattern, a square with side lengths of $100mm$ is a good start.

We can put the rats-nest down.

![rats-nest](/assets/img/mic_array/ratsnest.png)

The R-Pi breakout is placed on the opposite side to minimize interference of the Pi with the mics.


# Routing

Routing is done starting with the local areas, I place components as well as I can. I'm sure this could've been done better, but I'm not super experienced with this.

# 3D model

And now the final model looks like.
