# Problem Statement

## Passive Filter Design Project
This project is meant to be a collaboration, leading you through your thought process and ability to navigate this project.
Our goal with this exercise is to define, architect and implement a design generator for a large number of passive filters realizable on a userâ€™s PCB.
The filter(s) can be instantiated into user code via a function call similar to voltage-divider. The filter is instantiated as a jitx module with a fixed
input/output nomenclature and using parts lookup. This is language agnostic, please choose any language of choice!
### Filter Types
For this exercise, we would like eventually support of the following filter options:
- RC filters
- Nth order
- Low pass, band pass, high pass
- Spice sim verification
- LC filters
- Order from 1 to 7
- Low pass, band pass, high pass
- Bessel, Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic etc
- Global options
- Frequency specs
- Realizable components (availability)
- Optimize for area or cost
- Allow user to input preferences for component values
- Allow user to indicate BOM consolidation priority
### Initial Starting Point
To begin the exercise, we can try the following:
- Start with just RC filters
- LPF filter type
- Three stage filter
- Circuit diagram
- Frequency response to component values calculation
- How should we incorporate circuit and board-level non-idealities (parasitics)?
