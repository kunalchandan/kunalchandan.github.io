# Abstract

Micro LEDs ($\mu$LEDs) are an exciting, new technology that hold the
potential to improve upon the capabilities of the incumbent display
technologies of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and organic light
emitting diodes (OLEDs). Researchers and industry leaders deem $\mu$LEDs
capable of significant advantages in display technologies particularly
with key performance metrics in contrast, colour gamut, pixel response
timings, display lifetime, and power consumption. Currently, there are a
variety of technical challenges in fabrication to making the dream of
$\mu$LED displays a reality. During this research project I aim to
assist in developing a process for packaging $\mu$LEDdisplays onto an
addressable backplane. To achieve this we use electroplated indium to
create a mechanical and electrical connection between the $\mu$LEDs and
thin-film-transistor (TFT) backplane.

# Introduction

LEDs are exceptionally efficient when compared to legacy lighting
technologies like arc, incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and others.
The advantages inherent to the technology have allowed LEDs to enter a
variety of light applications like automotive, general lighting, and
display backlighting and many other use-cases. [@uLED_review]
Conventional inorganic LEDs have MESA dimensions generally greater than
$(300\times 300) \mu m ^2$, however
$\mu$LEDs target an area below
$(100\times 100) \mu m ^2$ to
$1 \mu m ^2$ [@parbrook2021micro]

One of the earliest claims to the discoveries of the LED was by Oleg
Losev in the 1920s, the work was generally ignored and the conjectured
theory for the operation was incorrect, the subsequent research also
focused on $\text{SiC}$ and @-@ semiconductors. This era of research was
generally impractical and did not produce sufficient light. However,
with the arrival of @-@ semiconductors like $\text{GaAs}$, $\text{GaSb}$,
$\text{InP}$, and $\text{SiGe}$ there was significant progress in
luminosity, although sadly this was all within the infrared spectrum.
Visible LEDs would emerge as research in the area quickened, the
technology was based on $\text{GaAsP}$ epitaxy over $\text{GaAs}$
substrates. This would bring forth the advent of commercializable LEDs
that would now be seen everywhere. Eventually efficiency and luminosity
would surpass that of traditional lighting solutions like filament based
tungsten and bring us to where we are today with LEDs being used in
nearly all lighting and display applications.

## Motivation for $\mu$ LEDs as a Technology


LCDs and OLEDs currently dominate the display market, each technology
comes with its trade-offs and current innovations with quantum dots and
fully addressable back-lit mini-LED panels aim to address some
shortcomings concerning contrast, colour accuracy, power consumption,
brightness, lifetime, and response times.

$\mu$LEDs aim to address many of these concerns as well, by offering a
number of advantages over traditional LCD and OLED displays. The biggest
advantage $\mu$LEDs would provide over LCDs is the power efficiency
where LCDs suffer from high power loss due to the multiple diffuser and
filtering layers required to compose a screen [@LCD_bad]. A commonly
cited number is that LCDs loose nearly 70-90% of the flux introduced by
the backlight to the various polarizing layers that comprise the
display. In contrast, as $\mu$LEDdisplays would be entirely emissive,
none of the light would be lost to the conventional filtering layers.

There are a variety of hurdles $\mu$LED technology, many of which arise
from the high production cost and the low external quantum efficiency of
the technology [@uledhurdles]. As such adoption has been infeasible as
yet.

# Indium Electroplating
## Introduction

As we are attempting to use indium as a diebonding material, there is
adequate justification for such use. Indium diebonding comes with a
variety of advantages, the first and foremost being that it is a very
forgiving material in a wide variety of ways [@indiumCorpBath]. Indium
electroplating can be done at room temperature, the material has a
useful low melting point of
$\approx 150 ^ \circ C$
[@indiumCorpConstants] and is also an incredibly soft and ductile
material. Lastly it also is very resistant to forming thick surface
oxides and easily wets to surfaces when it reaches its melting
temperature [@indium_diebonding].

Due to the many advantages of the material it is an easy choice to begin
with to minimize constraints on other portions of the project.

## Process

There are a variety of methods for indium electroplating, while I did
not select the electroplating process there are a variety of methods
available that are commonly used in industry. The largest differences
tend to be in what comprises the solution and the operating
temperatures.


The indium electroplating process is based on a now industry standard
process that is known to yield good results while requiring a minimum of
process optimization. Indium easily allows for wafer bumping where the
deformability, low melting point, and cold welding properties
[@indiumCorpPulsing]. While other alloys consisting of tin and lead or
tin, silver, and copper are also used for these processes they come with
other disadvantages such as large crystal sizes and high sensitivity to
temperature. The plating solution provided by Indium corporation
contains

Adapting the indium electroplating process to the E3-3139 and the
resources available there, the process is in .

The process used there allows us to electroplate indium onto the
substrate that is Chrome-Gold on Sapphire. Gold is an excellent material
for indium to easily electroplate onto, and is particularly effective
for eutectic bonding for $\text{In}-\text{Au}$ as the alloy that is formed
is able to effectively join the wafers [@waferBondingHandbook].

[@waferBondingHandbook]](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch1/indium_bonding.png){#fig:waferbondingdiagram

## Existing Setup Description


In summary the process has us prepare the sample with acids before
placing into the plating solution. Then the sample holder and sample are
submerged in the plating solution and the current source is applied.
However, due to cost constraints a voltage source was obtained to
perform in place of a current source.

![Image of the flat mouth alligator clip used to clamp onto the sample](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch1/Aligator_clip.jpeg){width="45%"}

A current source would have been preferred over a voltage source due to
several reasons. Since electroplating is a process where metal ions are
deposited on a substrate through the use of an electric current. The
amount of metal deposited is directly proportional to the amount of
electric charge that flows through the system, which means that
controlling the current is crucial for controlling the thickness and
quality of the plated layer.

With a current source, the current can be precisely controlled and
maintained at a constant level, which results in consistent and uniform
plating as a function of time. On the other hand, a voltage source may
not provide a consistent current, as the resistance of the plating
solution can vary due to factors such as temperature or impurities,
leading to poor plating results.

![Line drawing of the alligator clip and sample](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch1/Current%20Sample%20holder.png){width="30%"}

Another advantage of using a current source is that it allows for better
control over the plating process and reduces the risk of over-plating or
under-plating. With a voltage source, the voltage applied to the system
can cause the plating rate to fluctuate, which can result in uneven
thickness or even damage to the substrate. In contrast, a current source
ensures a constant and controlled deposition rate, which minimizes the
risk of defects or damage to the substrate.

Using a voltage source with an ammeter can be equivalent to a current
source in certain situations. This is because the voltage applied to a
circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it. By
measuring the current in the circuit using an ammeter, the current can
be controlled by adjusting the voltage. In this way, the voltage source
with an ammeter can effectively act as a current source.

![Picture of physical device.](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch1/electroplating_setup_picture.png){height="6cm"}

The sample holder consists of two plastic blocks that are held together
by two steel bars. Thumbscrews are used to lock the relative position of
the plastic pieces in place while the assembly 'floats' on the lip of
the beaker the sample is submerged into. One of the two plastic pieces
has a stopper that helps constrain the position of the assembly on the
beaker while the other plastic piece holds the glass rod and alligator
clip.

The glass rod is attached to the plastic piece and has the alligator
clip on it. The clip and corresponding cathode holder are wrapped in a
PTFE sleeve that helps minimize stray electric fields and electroplating
onto the cathode wire.

![GDS image of the layout. Indium is in green bumps have a diameter of 40 $\mu m$](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch1/GDS_V1.png)

## Physical Problems with the setup


The existing setup came with an analog voltage supply that was only able
to provide analog control of the voltage based on two knobs (a fine and
coarse). This control was only fine enough to
$\pm 10 mV$ where the derivative of
the current with respect to voltage in the relevant regime was
$\frac{d mA}{d mV} = \frac{0.3 mA}{1 mV}$.
This meant there was poor resolution on the current control with the
previous power-supply with a current resolution of
$\pm 3 mA$ which would be an
insufficient resolution for the small area that was being plated.

I replaced the existing voltage supply with a Tektronics function
generator as it provided an appropriate resolution and dynamic range for
such the task. The function generator would allow for pulsed plating as
recommended by the indium corporation [@indiumCorpGrainStructure]

## Experimental Issues - Deviation from Theory


According to the Indium corporation docs, the recommended electroplating
current density for plating is
$10-100 \frac{A}{ft^2}$ at
$20 \frac{A}{ft^2}$ we should observe
plating growth at
$1.5 \frac{mm}{hr}$.
Converting to SI units from ASME units we see that this yields a plating
current of
$J_{Plating} \approx 0.11-1.1 \frac{mA}{mm^2}\rightarrow I_{Plating} = 2.907 mA$.
However, in this analysis we have only considered the active plating
area of the sample, and we have failed to consider the plating area of
the exposed alligator clip that holds the sample.

The extra exposed area guarantees an incorrect characterization of the
plating growth proportional to the exposed area for the indium bumps. We
can show this simply from equation

$$\begin{split}
        V &\doteq I R \\
        I_{Plating} &\doteq J_{Plating} \times A_{Plating} \\
        R_{Total} &\doteq R_{Anode} + R_{Plating Solution} + R_{Cathode} + R_{Wires} \\
        V_{Plating} &\doteq \text{Variable to satisfy plating current}
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:v_eq_ir}$$

From the datasheets from Indium Corporation [@indiumCorpPlating] we see
that the recommended plating current density.

![SEM images of indium bumps for $2.4 mA$ current for $5 min$](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch1/24mA_Growth1.png "fig:")
![SEM images of indium bumps for $2.4 mA$ current for $5 min$](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch1/24mA_Growth2.png "fig:")

$$J_{Plating} = 10-100 \frac{A}{ft^2}$$

Or in more elegant units:

$$\notag
    \begin{split}
        J_{Plating} &\approx 0.11-1.1 \frac{mA}{mm^2}
    \end{split}$$

We can then solve for the plating current based on the exposed area
given by the GDS file of the sample in the gds in chapter 1.

The exposed area is thus:

$$\notag
    \begin{split}
        A_{Plating} &= \pi (20 \mu m)^2 + (4.5 mm\times 3 mm) \\
        &\approx 13.5 mm^2
    \end{split}$$

Thus, the plating current for a current density of
$20\frac{A}{ft^2}$ or
$0.2153 \frac{mA}{mm^2}$
which represents a growth rate of
$1.5\frac{mm}{hr}$
or
$25 \frac{\mu m }{min}$
is as follows.

$$\notag
    \begin{split}
        I_{Plating} &\doteq J_{Plating} \times A_{Plating} \\
        I_{Plating} &= (0.2153 \frac{mA}{mm^2}) \times (13.5 mm^2) \\
        I_{Plating} &= 2.907 mA
    \end{split}$$

However, when we apply a voltage of
$2.4 mA$ for 5 minutes the growth
we see in the $24 mA$ growth figure that the growth is between
$0.3-1.2 \mu m$ in thickness.

From those results we can see that the estimate of area that we
predicted we got $\frac{0.8}{25} \times 100\% = 3.2\%$ of the expected
growth. While that is not explicitly a problem, the indium bumps and
growth did not look very uniform or nearly thick enough compared to what
would be needed in the proceeding steps.

From here a number of more experiments were conducted and condensed
results of the growth were compiled in the plating growths table.

## Development of a Repeatable Process


In summary, the highlighted issues here have to do with the excessive
easy by which the sample holder assembly floats on the beaker, this can
in instances cause significant change in the plating rate as seen by the
large variance in plating rate as seen in the scatter plot figure.
I must ensure that the sample is well
aligned and distanced appropriately from the indium anode to minimize
confounding factors.

Secondly in this section we improved plating current control with the
use of a digital function generator and an ammeter in series. With this
control of the plating current density was significantly improved by
almost 1 order of magnitude.


# Phase 1 - Uniform Bonding
## Process


The process in this section will aim to first characterize the spread of
indium over the surface of the 'LED' and 'backplane' ('BP')
substrates [^1] and secondly validate uniform bonding over the surface
of the sample.

The process that will be used to explore this is the following.

1.  Electroplate indium onto a 'BP'

2.  Remove photoresist from sample with Acetone then IPA rinse or
    Remover PG (follow the instructions in [@RemoverPGds])

3.  Do surface activation of LED and BP using the plasma cleaner

4.  Place BP face up and LED face down on diebonder

5.  Using Pick-And-Place (P+P) function on diebonder, pick the LED and
    place on the BP using the specified bonding pressure and heat recipe

    Bonder Head

    :   Ensure that the bond head being used is a gimbal bond head [^2]

    P+P

    :   The recipe used on the diebonder for P+P is as following:

        -   Approach and lift the LED using the vacuum function with an
            application force of $30g$

        -   Complete translational and axial alignment of the LEDs to
            the BP using the flip-chip camera [^3]

        -   Ensure the eutectic bonding module is on and set to a place
            force of $3kg$

        -   Load the correct recipe:
            $10s \text{@} 60^ \circ C$
            followed by
            $3min \text{@} 250^ \circ C$

After a repeatable electroplating process for indium was developed, the
next step was to investigate how the indium would spread once
die-bonded. The spreading behaviour of indium is critical because it can
impact the performance of the semiconductor device. Specifically, the
spreading of indium can affect the heat dissipation and the electrical
contact between the die and the substrate. Understanding this behaviour
is essential for optimizing the performance of the device. This
knowledge can then be used to inform the design and manufacture of
semiconductor devices, improving their reliability and performance.
Diebonding is the process of placing a semiconductor chip onto a
substrate or package, and eutectic bonding is a common diebonding
technique. Understanding the behaviour of indium during eutectic bonding
is crucial for ensuring the reliability and performance of the final
device.

A flipchip diebonder is a machine that is used to bond microelectronic
chips directly onto a substrate. It allows for precise alignment and
bonding of the chip to the substrate, which is essential for the proper
functioning of microelectronic devices. In addition to the standard
bonding techniques, a flipchip diebonder with eutectic bonding
capabilities enables the bonding of two chips by bonding with precise
control of heat and pressure, which can greatly enhance the reliability
and performance of the microelectronic device. Eutectic bonding is a
specialized technique that involves heating the two materials to their
eutectic point, at which they melt and fuse together, creating a bond.
[^4] This makes the flipchip diebonder with eutectic bonding capability
a valuable tool in the field of microelectronics for high-performance
and reliable bonding of chips to substrates.

The diebonder being used is the 'TRESKY-diebond' tool in the QNC
packaging lab it is the Tresky T-3000-FC3 model. The tool is capable of
providing a bonding force of up to $490 N$ ($50 kg$
mass) may be applied at temperatures up to
$400 ^ \circ C$. The datasheet suggests
that it offers placement accuracy of
$\pm10\mu m$ [@diebonderDatasheet],
While not specified, there are also inherent limitations to the axial
accuracy due to the backlash in the gearing of the rotational alignment
system.

## Characterization of Indium Bonding Spread {#sec:indiumSpread}


In this section, we will explore the characterization of indium
spreading during the diebonding process. The primary goal is to gain a
deeper understanding of how the indium will melt and spread during the
process. We will achieve this by analyzing SEM images of the initial
volume and microscope images taken after diebonding. Through this
analysis, we aim to identify and quantify the parameters that influence
indium spreading and develop an understanding of the fundamental
mechanisms involved. The insights gained from this section will help
optimize the diebonding process and improve the quality of the final
product.

When indium is deposited on a substrate, it forms cylindrical columns
that are circular when viewed from the top. During the diebonding
process, the indium will melt and spread to form a bond between the
substrate and the die. We expect the indium to spread in a circular
fashion due to the surface tension of the liquid metal and due to the
physical constraints for the material to move when being in essence
'squeezed' between two plates. As the indium melts, its surface will try
to minimize its surface area and form a shape with the lowest surface
area possible, which in this case is a circle. Therefore, understanding
the spreading behaviour of the indium is crucial for achieving a
successful diebonding process.

Since we want to calculate and understand how the indium will conform
when bonding is done, a number of characterization measurements were
conducted to understand how the indium will spread and expand over the
sample surface. We know the volume of indium will not change when
diebonding occurs, we can model the spread of indium as a flattening of
a cylinder.

$$\label{eq:radius_indium}
    \begin{split}
        V_{Cylinder Initial} &= V_{Cylinder Final} \\
        \pi \times r_{Initial}^2 \times h_{Initial} &= \pi \times r_{Final}^2 \times h_{Final} \\
        \sqrt{\frac{h_{Initial}}{h_{Final}}} r_{Initial} &= r_{Final} \\
        \sqrt{\frac{h_{Initial}}{ 0.65 \mu m}} r_{Initial} &= r_{Final}

Based on a number of bonding experiments I determined that the average
thickness of indium after bonding was around
$0.65 \mu m$ a sample of the indium
bump can be seen in figure.

  : Table of estimated thickness post diebonding
:::

From the table after removing outlier values, the median resulting
thickness is $~65 \mu m$.

The spread values were identified from images taken from the microscope
'OLYMPUS-scope3' in the packaging lab.

From the images captured by the scope, we can see that the gimbal head in
the lab provides sufficiently uniform bonding pressure over the bonding
area. The images also show that there is spreading of the indium as the
bond is formed directly as a function of the indium volume. This is
clear from the fact that the initial electroplated area indicated in a
light grey is $42\mu m$ in size and the
spread area indicated in dark grey is around
$100 \mu m$ in size.

This corresponds to what we see in. Where the initial height of the indium
growth from what we expect in where the growth is estimated to be
$4-5\mu m$ in thickness.

$$\label{eq:radius_indium2}
    \begin{split}
        \sqrt{\frac{h_{Initial}}{ 0.65 \mu m}} 21 \mu m&= r_{Final} \mu m\\
        52.1 &\approx 50 \mu m
    \end{split}$$

Knowing that the bond does spread will constrain the maximum density of
$\mu$LEDs for a given bump thickness.

## Validation of Uniform Bonding {#sec:uniformBond}


To validate that the bonding of the LEDs to the BP was uniform
microscope images of the bonds were taken from the LED into the bond
surface. As the LEDs for this phase of tests are largely transparent and
mainly just dots of gold, it is very easy to see the spread of the
indium bonds, this can be seen in the images.

The gimbal head that is used has a structure like what is seen in figure allows for ???

## Thermal Simulations


Thermal simulations were conducted because there were some bonding
failures seen in the samples. As can be seen from SEM images and
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS) the indium does not
always appropriately wet onto the other substrate being bonded onto this
is seen in the SEM images in figure and EDX images in figure.
There can be various reasons why indium
does not wet onto a surface during diebonding. One reason could be the
presence of surface contaminants such as oxides or oils, which can
prevent the indium from bonding to the surface. Another reason could be
an insufficient amount of heat or pressure during the diebonding
process, which can cause the indium to not properly wet onto the
surface. Additionally, the surface energy of the substrate can also
affect the ability of indium to wet onto the surface during diebonding.

To explore further a lack of heat, thermal simulations were conducted to
identify if a process change in the diebonding preprocess was required.
Thermal simulations were done in MATLAB with the following code in .

The results from the thermal simulations as seen in figure
[61](#fig:thermal_simulations){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:thermal_simulations"} in MATLAB were that there was more
than sufficient time and heat to melt and wet the indium onto the
opposing surface. As a result the lack of wetting was likely a result of
one of the other issues (contaminants from the flip-chip process or some
failure in the surface energies). Both of the other issues are quite
possible as during the process the substrate that is bonding onto the
substrate with indium on the surface is face down on the 'diebonder'
which is an unclean surface that also does not have the appropriate
surface energies and could dissipate the surface energy generated during
the plasma cleaning process.

It can be seen from the thermal simulations that the time taken for the
indium to reach temperature is well within $0.3 s$ whereas
the bonding recipe calls for the sample to sit at
$250 ^ \circ C$ for $5 min$.
This is well within 2 orders of magnitude of time for the sample to
reach temperature, as such it would be safe to assume that
heat/temperature or lack thereof is not the causal source of failure.

## Conformation to Theory


In this section we wanted to ensure that there was uniform bonding
across the area of the sample, this would arise from the bonding head
providing relatively uniform bonding force over the sample area. From
the microscope images in the microscope images of the indium we can see that the spread of the
indium bumps is uniform over the area of the sample, this would be
representative of the gimbal head providing relatively uniform pressure
over the face of the sample.

Furthermore, we can also see that the bonding would spread according to
the calculated volume. To validate that the indium was spreading as
expected, bumps were electroplated to achieve a width of
$40 \mu m$. To achieve this we can use
equation where we conserve the volume of indium. We
can assume that we can consistently generate indium bumps of width
$h_{Initial} = 7\mu m$

$$\label{eq:initial_radius}
    \begin{split}
        \sqrt{\frac{h_{Initial}}{ 0.65 \mu m}} r_{Initial} &= r_{Final} \\
        r_{Initial} &= \sqrt{\frac{h_{Initial}}{ 0.65 \mu m}}^{-1}r_{Final} \\
        r_{Initial} &= \sqrt{\frac{7 \mu m}{ 0.65 \mu m}}^{-1} 40 \mu m\\
        r_{Initial} &= 12 \mu m
    \end{split}$$

The new GDS files for the altered indium bumps that should achieve a
thickness of $40 \mu m$ looks like
figure [62](#fig:12um_bumps_gds){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:12um_bumps_gds"}.

After proceeding with the bonding the new images from the microscope
look as follows in figure. The images look different as
these samples were prepared for the following process in chapter. However, the test for bonding performance is
still relevant.

As can be clearly seen in the images that although there is some error
in bonding spread, at this scale the placement accuracy limitations play
a more significant role and constrain the critical dimension for the
bond diameter. Furthermore, the bond size appears to conform to our
expectations and reaches a size close to what was predicted.

While the size of the bonds deviate from the preliminary theory this is
in part due to the basic modelling of the indium bumps that are assumed
to be perfect cylinders. It is clear from the images taken with the SEM
that this is not the case and both over plating and under plating cause
serious decision from expected results

While results seemed promising with the bonding the bonds from this
series of experiments broke very easily. Many of the resulting bonds did
not last long enough for the pick and place to remove the head and
others failed to last long enough to be transported across the lab to
the microscope for imaging of the bonds. In the bond failures section I discuss the method by which the
$\text{AuIn2}$ bond forms and why failures occur.

## Bond failures {#sec:bond_failures}


This section will complete a small literature review as to how the bond
between the LED and BP forms and why there is failure in the previous
experiments.

The *Handbook of Wafer Bonding* [@waferBondingHandbook] suggests that a
typical $\text{In-Au}$ bump consists of a
$3\mu m$ thick indium layer and a
$0.3\mu m$ thick gold layer. The
diagram in part (a) shows what a typical
construction of a microbump looks like. While there are differences in
the way we construct our bond which looks like. The resulting product should be
relatively similar.

As described in the handbook.

> In addition, the $\text{Au - In}$ microbump has a relatively low yield
> strength, and thus undergoes plastic deformation under a mechanical
> load, which can help relieve mechanical stresses induced in the bonded

> As the temperature increases above
> $156^ \circ C$, the molten indium

> [1](#fig:waferbondingdiagram){reference-type="ref"

> temperature, the solidification of the mixture starts below
> $156^ \circ C$ to form indium - rich
> $\text{Au - In}$ alloys.

Thus, the tensile strength of the alloy is comparable to that of
$\text{In}$ which has a tensile strength of
$1.6 MPa$ [@indiumCorpConstants] and
a shear strength of $6.1 MPa$.

Given that we have a bonded area of:

$$\label{eq:bonded_area}
    \begin{split}
        A_{Bonded} &\doteq (6\times 6) \pi r^2 \\
        &= (6\times 6) \pi (20 \mu m)^2 \\
        &= 45239 \mu m ^2= 0.04524 mm^2
    \end{split}$$

The tensile strength is given by equation
[\[eq:tensile\]](#eq:tensile){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:tensile"}.

$$\label{eq:tensile}
    \begin{split}
        \sigma &= \frac{F_{tensile}}{A} \\
        1.6 MPa\times A_{Bonded} &= F_{tensile} \\
        72.4 mN &= F_{tensile}
    \end{split}$$

The calculated tensile strength is extremely low, and the sheer strength
is on a similar order of magnitude
($F_{shear} = 276 mN$). This tensile and shear
strength is only one order of magnitude greater than the mass of the LED
and BP which are
$M = \rho_{Sapphire} \times V_{LED + BP} = 0.21 g \rightarrow F_{g} = M g = 2.1 mN$.
Due to the inaccuracies of the diebonder we do not observe 100% overlap
of the active bonding area which significantly reduces our margins
required for maintaining a bond, furthermore the diebonder vacuum system
has easily ripped the LED off of a bonded LED and BP pair with
sub-nominal vacuum pressure.

Since the current setup fails very easily it requires a solution before
we can proceed to the daisy-chain tests in the next chapter. I explain
in further detail in the following section how I approached how to
resolve this issue.

## Development of a Repeatable Process {#sec:Ch2_repeatable}


As previously described a number of bonds did not last long enough for
the diebonder to remove the head from on top of the LEDs. While we
expected the bonds to be mechanically insecure, we still expected them
to handle careful transport for a few days while characterization could
be done. Instead, we observed immediate failures. These failures could
have been as a result of a variety of reasons, some of these reasons
were described in the previous chapter. To avoid tautology the solutions
discussed here were to improve the cleanliness of the handling of
samples and to increase the bonded area that would bond the LED to the
BP.

### Adding Anchors


I wanted to add anchors to significantly improve the tensile strength of
the bond. To complete this, inactive areas of the LED sample had
portions where $\mu$LEDs would not be placed where the $\text{Cr}-\text{Au}$
would not be etched away. Furthermore, on the BP those corresponding
areas would have indium electroplated. The corresponding GDS file of the
LED and BP look like.

![GDS file of LED and BP. Anchors added in alignment marks and between active areas. ](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch2/DC_DieBTest_V5.GDStex_output.pdf-1.png)

The anchors in figure increase the bonding area by orders of magnitude
while maintaining the functionality of the previous design. The new area
is given by the folowing.

$$\label{eq:new_area}
    \begin{split}
        A_{New} &\doteq \underbrace{(6\times 6) \pi r^2}_{\text{Area of bonds to LEDs}} \underbrace{((5\times 5) 260\mu m\times 40\mu m) + ((2\times 2 \times 4) 150\mu m\times 150 \mu m)}_{\text{Anchors}} \\
        &= (6\times 6) \pi (20 \mu m)^2  + 620000 \mu m ^2\\
        &= 665239 \mu m ^2= 0.6652 mm^2
    \end{split}$$

As the new bonded area is well over 14 times greater
($\frac{A_{New}}{A_{Old}} = 14.704$) the corresponding tensile and shear
strength should also scale accordingly. As the purpose of this series of
experiments is not to develop the strongest possible mechanical bonds
between wafers, and the current solution was sufficient for our
purposes. No further tests into the strength of bonds were conducted
because the bonds held the samples together as seen in figure
follwing figures.

# Phase 2 - Electrical Connection
## Process


In this section we would like to characterize the performance of the
electrical connection of the LED to the BP of the process. Since an
excellent electrical connection throughout the entire circuit and
display is required to power the LEDs and transistors on the backplane
it is important to understand the non-idealities that will be
encountered in the sample.

To characterize the electrical connection over the sample a daisy-chain
test will be conducted [@daisychainTest].

A daisy-chain test for diebonding with indium to bond an LED to a
backplane involves bonding a series of LED chips to the backplane
sequentially. Each LED chip is bonded using indium diebonding, and the
bonding quality and electrical performance of each LED is evaluated
before proceeding to bond the next LED in the chain.

The purpose of the daisy-chain test is to ensure that each LED is bonded
correctly and functions properly before bonding the next one. This
allows for early detection and correction of any bonding issues, and
ensures that the final product is of high quality.

We will be using the same GDS file as the one with the added
anchors and using a micromanipulator to probe the pads seen on the
outside of the GDS file.

![GDS file of bonded LED and BP. ](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch2/DC_DieBTest_V5.GDStex_output.pdf-1.png)

## Characterization of Electrical Connection


Going through the entire electroplating and diebonding process, I was
able to begin the process of characterizing the electrical properties of
the diebonds. As I was using the micromanipulator in E3-3177 there were
certain limitations and intricacies to using the tool that were not
relevant to the characterization, but I felt the need to mention.

-   The diebonded samples were significantly larger than the field of
    view of the microscope. This meant I had to translate the sample
    stage to move the test pads into view.

-   Some probes suffered from significant static friction and high
    damping ratio which meant that translation of those probes faced
    significant lag when being used.

-   One of the ocular lenses had a focal distance outside the z-axis
    range of the stage.

-   The ocular lenses also faced significant vignetting.

-   Some geared belt drives did not work.

While the previous issues did exist, there were no functional issues
with the micromanipulator and the tool was absolutely functional for use
in this situation.

## Connection Issues


To complete the electrical characterization of the daisy-chain samples,
the probes of the micromanipulator were attached to a Kiethley Source
Measurement Unit (SMU). The SMU allows us to apply voltages and currents
and measure voltages, currents, and resistances. Upon attempting to
measure the resistance of the sample, at first an 'overflow' or
open-circuit was measured.

To overcome this at first a small voltage below
$1 V$ and was gradually increased up-to
$20 V$ until a current was measured. This
procedure of applying a high voltage is likely similar to what is often
seen in oxide breakdown of transistors [@oxide_breakdown] where an oxide
layer is broken down and promotes the creation of a conductive material
from the source to discharge point. However, it is still unclear as to
why this surface oxide appears as indium should not have formed a
surface oxide layer as according to [@indiumCorpSurfacePrep] an oxide
layer of a maximum of $80-100 Å$ would form after
$2-4h$ this oxide layer should have been removed by the
preceding plasma-cleaning step [@plasma_clean_oxide] and diebonding
should have easily melted the indium forming a bond that would work.

Once connection issues were resolved the resistance over the pads were
measured. While measuring, however, the resistances over the pads was
constantly in flux at a rate of change of
$1-4 \frac{\Omega}{min}$.

## Conformation to Theory


The results of the measurements were as follows from table

Since the resistance of each section of the daisy-chain circuit can have
some theoretical resistance calculated using a basic equation for
resistance where the resistance is given by some
function of the resistivity, length and cross-sectional area of the
wire. Similarly, using the equivalent schematic from  we can try to characterize the
resistance of the indium bonds.

For the full row of the circuit in figure the total resistivity is given by
equation.

$$\begin{split}

        R_{Total}   &= 4 R_{\text{In}} + \frac{\rho_{\text{Au}} (1500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 1500) \mu m}{200nm\times 20\mu m} \\
        R_{\text{In}} &= \frac{\frac{\rho_{\text{Au}} 4500 \mu m}{200nm\times 20\mu m} - R}{4} \\
        R_{\text{In}} &= \frac{R_{Total} - 25}{4}
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:resist_top}$$

Similar calculations to equation can be done for the other portions of the
daisy-chain tests.

This results in the bond electrical resistance values in figure.

## Development of a Repeatable Process


### Minimizing Process temperature


Since we were observing bonds that were failing and being difficult
potentially due to the surface oxidation, it was suggested to minimize
the process temperature after the electroplating, as such the HMDS
application step which reaches a temperature of
$160^ \circ C$ was removed. The other
warm process steps

### Improving cleanliness of process


I acquired a 4-inch wafer to place the LED on while it was being picked
up for diebonding. The wafer is also surface activated and placed in the
plasma cleaner with the rest of the samples to ensure it is also
relatively clean. The wafer when not being used is placed in the wafer
carrier tray. The wafer was added to ensure that the surface energy of
the LED sample when face-down is not affected as compared to when face
down on the diebonder surface.

Furthermore, the bonding head is regularly cleaned with IPA before being
used to minimize likelihood of sticking to the diebonder head.


# Phase 3 - Bonding to LEDs
## Process


In this section functional LEDs will be used to test the entire process
and validate that this process can then later be used to bond a BP with
actual transistors. The most major difference between this experiment
and the previous ones will be the fact that the LEDs will consist of a
'mesa' structure. This structure will require that the electroplating
process can complete conformal coating onto the structure.

The GDS files for the LED, BP and overlay of both are in figure

![GDS file of BP.](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch4/ONOFF_NC_2022_V3.GDS_BP.pdf-1.png)

![GDS file of overlay of LED on BP.](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch4/ONOFF_NC_2022_V3.GDS_BOTH.pdf-1.png)

## Bonding Issues


Upon attempting to diebond the LED to the backplane, all 3 attempts
failed, the remaining BP and LED were withheld to do SEM imaging. From
the images taken, it appeared to be that the bonds had a very
insufficient thickness of indium present. However, the coating of indium
did appear to be conformal.

As seen from the SEM images of the non-bonded samples in figures and the thickness of indium that was
generated during the electroplating process was not nearly thick enough
for the expected results of $4-6\mu m$.
I believe that this was likely an issue that arose due to the poor
formation of electric fields during the electroplating process as most
other variables were fairly well accounted for.

![Bonded SEM image of BP](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch4/Phase-4/P4-T02/BP/IMG_No0006.png)

To analyze this further, 2D electrical simulations were conducted to
understand how the electric fields are generated during the
electroplating process. The reference code can be seen in the Appendix.

The resulting electric field from the code looks like figure.

![Dirty electric field lines as a result of the alligator clip in solution.](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch4/dirty_field_lines_aligator.png)

 

![Clean electric field lines when there would be no alligator clip present.](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch4/clean_field_lines.png)


## Conformation to Theory


As the theory from the previous section would suggest that there would
be a greater flux of indium into the sections near the alligator clip.
This can be clearly seen in figure where there is a significant bias of
indium near the region with the alligator clip attached.


## Development of a Repeatable Process {#development-of-a-repeatable-process-2}


The existing process failed after verification of previous metrics. As
many of the previous issues were resolved methodically, there is likely
an inherent flaw with the existing electroplating setup.

To improve the electroplating process I would like to complete the
following goals:

-   Minimize movement of overall system.

-   Make electric field lines more uniform.

-   Minimize variability between electroplating runs.

To achieve the previous goals, I would like to propose the following
solutions:

-   Fix the anode(indium bar) into a rigid fixture that maximizes
    flatness of the bar.

-   Fix the distance between the anode and cathode with a rigid
    structure.

-   Maximize uniformity of the electric fields by ensuring no other
    conductors are available on the same plane or between the anode and
    cathode.

To complete these goals a number of 3D models were designed and revised
until they could meet the design requirements.

Furthermore, once the designs have been prototyped, it is necessary that
appropriate materials are selected to function appropriately in the
chemical conditions that the sample experiences.

![Open face section of anode holder with slices for 3D printing or smaller CNC machines.](/assets/img/report_resources/Ch4/3D_models/Anode-Holder-Open-Face.png)

Since the 3D designs in would meet the specifications indicated
earlier, appropriate material selection would be required.

As such materials were selected to meet chemical resistance properties
for the harshest chemicals that would be used in the process
($15\% \text{HCl}$). While a variety of plastics met the requirements
including PEEK, PTFE, HDPE and many others [@margolis2006engineering],
HDPE was selected as it was many orders of magnitude cheaper than PEEK
or PTFE and was also much more easily machinable.

This selection would allow for more easy prototyping while meeting all
the functional requirements.

## Chemical Hazards

No new chemicals are being introduced into the lab, and the SDS of the
chemicals relevant to the experiment are attached with the following
SOP.

-   Sulfamic Acid

-   Indium Sulfamate Plating Bath

## Safety Procedure

<!-- 2.3ex .2ex -->

-   Lab apron, rubber gloves, safety goggles, face-shield, and
    closed-toed shoes must be worn before interacting with any chemicals

-   To avoid spills ready all beakers and bottles under the fume-hood
    over clean room wipes before opening

-   Use care when opening and pouring chemicals to avoid spills during
    the preparation and process of the experiment

-   Do not touch your face or exposed skin during the process of the
    experiment

-   Always wash hands after handling any chemicals or materials

-   Avoid inhaling the mist or vapour of the chemicals, and avoid
    exposure to eyes and skin

-   Perform the entire experiment under a fume hood

## Process Flow
1.  Prepare the fume hood surface:

    1.  Place clean room wipes on the surface of the fume hood.

    2.  Ensure your name and contact information are visible at the work
        location in case people need to contact you.

    3.  Chemicals in the beakers should be identified, and all beakers
        should be labelled with what chemicals will be in them.

2.  Place the digital hotplate with stirring functionality inside the
    fume hood.

    1.  Do not place a wipe on the hotplate surface. This interferes
        with the transmission of heat to the beaker and its contents. It
        may also present a fire hazard. This is regardless of weather
        the heating element will be used.

    2.  Do NOT turn on the heating element over the course of this
        experiment.

3.  Set all four beakers (2x 2L, 1x 400mL, 1x 200mL) under the fume
    hood, and set one 2L beaker on the hotplate. Place the stir bar
    inside the beaker on the hotplate.

4.  Build the Custom Sample Holder and place in the beaker on the
    hotplate at the appropriate distance for the electroplating process
    ( 5 cm).

5.  Place the indium anode into the beaker on the hotplate, ensure that
    there is an appropriate distance from the sample and ensure that the
    electrode is connected to an alligator clip. Be sure to use fresh
    gloves when handling the indium electrode to avoid contamination.

    1.  Anode/cathode distance may alter grain size and uniformity of
        electroplating.

    2.  It is essential that the sample is perpendicular to the normal
        of the anode (indium)

6.  Ensure that all PPE is worn appropriately, and no skin is exposed.

7.  Acquire the indium sulfamate solution, sulfamic acid, and diluted
    HCl solutions from the Acids cabinet and transport it to the fume
    hood.

    1.  Pour the indium sulfamate solution into the beaker on the
        hotplate.

        *Ensure that the hotplate is OFF and the beaker is at room
        temperature to avoid shattering glass*

    2.  Pour the sulfamic acid into the 200mL beaker

    3.  Pour the HCl dilution into the 400mL beaker

    4.  Pour  2L of DI water into the remaining large beaker

    5.  Turn on stirring to  300RPM

8.  Check the pH of the indium sulfamate solution and verify it is
    between 1.5 and 2. If the pH exceeds 2 titrate sulfamic acid and mix
    until the pH enters the range again.

    1.  Titration of sulfamic acid into the indium sulfamate solution
        can be done using a pipette that is labelled and only to be used
        for sulfamic acid. Since the exact pH is not important titration
        with a pipette is sufficient and a buret is not required.

    2.  Note that all tools used in the titration process must be rinsed
        with DI water and dried with N2.

9.  Power should ideally be supplied with a pulsed constant current
    source and set to values in accordance with current over the plating
    surface area.

    1.  Ensure that the power supply is set and ready but disconnected
        from the sample now.

    2.  Measure the surface area of the sample and validate that current
        supplied to the sample is nominal to $10-20A/ft^2$ or
        $0.01-0.02A/cm^2$. For the current design this corresponds to
        nominal values of (0.02A, 0.1V)

    3.  Power should be connected as NEGATIVE terminal to sample and
        POSITIVE terminal to indium anode

    4.  Electroplating time is a function of the current density and
        expected final thickness of the deposited indium.

10. Rinse the sample with DI water, place into HCl solution for the
    activation time ( 5 min), rinse again with DI water, and place into
    the sulfamic acid solution for cleansing ( 3 min).

    1.  The sample should be attached to the custom holder

    2.  The HCl solution is required for cleaning and acid-activation
        (see the guide to indium plating).

    3.  The sulfamic acid ensures the pH of the base mentalization
        surface remains acidic and no reformation of oxide occurs.

11. Place the sample into the plating bath at the appropriate distance
    and turn on the power supply for the target plating time.

    -   See the Indium electroplating guide for more information on how
        this affects the grain size

[^1]: The LED and backplane are in quotes as these are not actual LEDs
    or backplanes with transistors, but instead are mock samples with
    similar physical characteristics. Those characteristics being the
    sample size and the $\text{In}-\text{Au}$ coating on the samples.
    Differences arise from the lack of a MESA structure that will be
    seen in the successive chapter
    [\[sec:BondingToLEDS\]](#sec:BondingToLEDS){reference-type="ref"
    reference="sec:BondingToLEDS"}

[^2]: Gimbal diebonding head is used to minimize non-uniformity of
    bonding pressure over the surface of the sample

[^3]: Due to the limitations of the diebonder in the packaging lab,
    alignment must be done on only one section of the viewfinder. This
    is due to the non-planar alignment of the optical path in the
    flip-chip camera.

[^4]: The material and strength properties of the bond will be discussed
    further in the chapter in section

ABSTRACT       = {Compared with conventional display technologies, liquid crystal display (LCD), and organic light emitting diode (OLED), micro-LED displays possess potential advantages such as high contrast, fast response, and relatively wide colour gamut, low power consumption, and long lifetime. Therefore, micro-LED displays are deemed as a promising technology that could replace LCD and OLED at least in some applications. While the prospects are bright, there are still some technological challenges that have not yet been fully resolved in order to realize the high volume commercialization, which include efficient and reliable assembly of individual LED dies into addressable arrays, full colour schemes, defect and yield management, repair technology and cost control. In this article, we review the recent technological developments of micro LEDs from various aspects.},
